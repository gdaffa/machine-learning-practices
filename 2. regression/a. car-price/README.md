# Car Price Prediction Model

**Car Price Prediction Model** is the first project from `machine-learning-practices`. It is also my first project written entirely in English, aiming to **improve my analytical and documentation skills in English language**. This project also aims to **improve my understanding about machine learning regression models**, and how to **compare each models performance using evaluation metrics**.
